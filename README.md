# Project Overview

Our project offers individuals who suspect they may have Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) a reliable assessment of their likelihood of having the condition. 

## Key Features

- **Accurate Risk Assessment**: Users complete a questionnaire, and their risk level is evaluated using an AI model trained on various CHF risk indicators.
  
- **User-Friendly Results**: Results are presented through an easy-to-read PyChart, allowing users to quickly understand their risk level.
  
- **Guidance for Next Steps**: We provide recommendations on how users can improve their condition based on their assessment results.

## Purpose

This project aims to assist individuals who suspect they may have CHF in determining whether they should seek further evaluation or make lifestyle changes to mitigate their risk of developing the disease.
